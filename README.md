# Budget Tracker

This budget tracker assignment allows users to not only see their budget, but also add and subtract money from the total. When the user adds a description about the deposit or withdraw, the user will then enter the desired amount, then hit either add or subtract. The total will then be reflected.

In addition to tracking the budget, this app is functional offline. It will keep track of deposits or withdraws online, then when the app is back online the total will remain the same as it did when it was offline.

Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
